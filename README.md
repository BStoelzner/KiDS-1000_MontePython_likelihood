This repository contains the likelihood modules for the KiDS-1000 (in short: K1K) COSEBIs, Bandpowers, and 2-point correlation function measurements from [Asgari et al. 2020 (arXiv:2007.15633)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200715633A).
The module will be working 'out-of-the-box' within this KCAP setup and an additional install of [MontePython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public) and [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) (version >= 2.8 including the HMcode module) setup. The required KiDS-1000 data files can be downloaded from the [KiDS science data webpage](http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/sciencedata.php) and the parameter file for reproducing the fiducial run of [Asgari et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200715633A) is supplied in the subfolder `INPUT`.

The '_2cosmos' subfolders contain the likelihood modules that were used in Section B.2 of [Asgari et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200715633A) for a consistency analysis following the methodology developed in [KÃ¶hlinger et al. 2019 (MNRAS, 484, 3126)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484.3126K).
These likelihoods can only be run with the modified 'Monte Python 2cosmos' version of Monte Python, i.e. [montepython_2cosmos_public](https://github.com/fkoehlin/montepython_2cosmos_public) which calls two independent instances of [CLASS](https://github.com/legourg/class_public) (version >= 2.8 including the HMcode module) and required KCAP modules and which also keeps the relevant cosmological parameter dictionaries separate, so that each subset of the mutually exclusive split of the main dataset is assigned its own copy of cosmological (and nuisance) parameters. The two subsets are still coupled through their joint covariance though to properly account for their correlations. To compare the split parameters then to the joint parameters and to compare the evidences for the Bayes factor a comparison run with the regular K1K likelihoods is required within a standard [MontePython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public) and [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) (version >= 2.6 and including the HMcode module) setup. The required KiDS-1000 data files can be downloaded from the [KiDS science data webpage](http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/sciencedata.php) and the parameter file for reproducing the split runs of [Asgari et al. 2020 (arXiv:2007.15633)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200715633A) is supplied in the subfolder `INPUT`.

Assuming that KCAP and MontePython (with CLASS version >= 2.8 including the HMcode module) are set up (we recommend to use nested sampling), please proceed as follows:

1) Copy `K1K_COSEBIs`, `K1K_BandPowers`, and `K1K_CorrelationFunctions` or their '2cosmos' equivalent from this folder into `/your/path/to/montepython_public/montepython/likelihoods/`.

(you can rename the folder to whatever you like, but you must use this name then consistently for the whole likelihood which implies to rename the `*.data`-file, including the prefixes of the parameters defined in there, the name of the likelihood in the `__init__.py`-file and also in the `*.param`-file.)

2) Set the path to the data folder (i.e. `KiDS-1000_DATA_RELEASE` from the tarball available from the [KiDS science data webpage](http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/sciencedata.php') in `K1K_[COSEBIs, BandPowers, or CorrelationFunctions].data` and modify parameters as you please (note that everything is set up to reproduce the fiducial run with `K1K_[COSEBIs, BandPowers, or CorrelationFunctions].param`).

3) Start your runs using e.g. the `K1K_COSEBIs.param` supplied in the subfolder `INPUT`.

4) If you publish your results based on using this likelihood, please cite [Asgari et al. 2020 (arXiv:2007.15633)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200715633A) and all further references for the KiDS-1000 data release (as listed on the [KiDS science data webpage](http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/sciencedata.php)) and also all relevant references for KCAP, Monte Python and CLASS.

Refer to `mpirun_with_multinest.sh` or `mpirun_with_polychord.sh` within the subfolder `INPUT` for all MultiNest and PolyChord-related settings that were used for the fiducial runs.

As of version 3.3.0 of [MontePython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public), S_8 is not implemented as a sampling parameter. To reproduce the fiducial run of [Asgari et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200715633A) you need to enable S_8 sampling in `/your/path/to/montepython_public/montepython/data.py`

WARNING: This likelihood only produces valid results for `\Omega_k = 0`, i.e. flat cosmologies!
